# üîß Vehicle Engine Health Monitoring (KDD Methodology)

This project leverages the **KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)** methodology to analyze and monitor vehicle engine health using machine learning techniques.
It showcases how structured data mining and analysis can reveal hidden patterns, detect anomalies, and predict engine failures ‚Äî supporting predictive maintenance and performance optimization.

## üìò Project Overview

The **KDD process** is a comprehensive approach to transforming raw data into actionable knowledge.
In this notebook, it is applied to **vehicle engine health monitoring** through a series of systematic steps:

1. **Selection** ‚Äì Identify and collect relevant data (engine telemetry, sensor logs, maintenance records).
2. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Handle missing values, noise, and data inconsistencies.
3. **Transformation** ‚Äì Create meaningful features and prepare data for analysis.
4. **Data Mining** ‚Äì Apply machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery and anomaly detection.
5. **Interpretation/Evaluation** ‚Äì Assess model performance and extract insights to support decision-making.
